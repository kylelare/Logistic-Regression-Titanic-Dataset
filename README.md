# Logistic-Regression-Titanic-Dataset
This repository contains code I wrote for the Titanic- Machine Learning from Disaster kaggle competition. Using the datasets available from https://www.kaggle.com/c/titanic the goal of the competition was to develope a machine learning algorithm that could predict whether a person would have survived the sinking of the Titanic based on a few features such as age or sex. I used feature engineering and logistic regression to develop my model which had a precision of 0.76 and recall of 0.76. This is still a work in progress and I plan on adding some visualizations and may possibly experimenting with other machine learning models for the dataset eventually.
